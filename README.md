# Snake Game

  The concept of Snake originated from the 1976 arcade game Blockade, developed by a British company called Gremlin Interactive, which shut down in 1984. Blockade was designed as a two-player game in which each would guide their own snakes, leaving a solid line behind them.
 
# Description

  Snake is a video game genre where the player maneuvers a line, typically called a snake, that grows bigger after eating something, typically apples, making the snake a primary obstacle to itself. 
  
  # How To Play
  
  The player controls a dot on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. The snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head (the length increases when the snake eats the blinking dot). The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border (the walls can be disabled) or itself.
